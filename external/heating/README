The main goal of this module is to calculate the deposited energy in form of heating, ionization and Lyman alpha processes.

There are two different kinds of heating that are interesting here: the heating of the baryons and the heating of the photons.
 - For photons, we do not actually calculate any changes in their temperature or density etc.
   Instead, we simply model any energy that modifies the photon spectrum as a small
   distortion to the blackbody spectrum. This either manifests in tiny temperature shifts
   (g-distortion, or dT distortion), or as a change in the spectral shape
   (mainly y and mu distortions, depending on the effectivity of energy-redistribution mechanisms).
 - For baryons, this treatment is not enough. While compared to the huge photon energy budget
   all injection mechanisms must be small, for baryons this is not true. The baryon temperature
   might strongly react to injected energy. Sometimes the energy will be used to heat the baryons,
   but it can also ionize them, or excite the lyman-alpha level of hydrogen.
   The minimal energy to have an effect on baryons is around 10.2 eV, which is derived from the
   1s->2p transition in HI, which is the smallest transition a 1s electron in neutral hydrogen can make.
   We thus group together photons with enough energy to completely ionize HeI, to completely ionize HI,
   photons with enough energy to excite the lyman-alpha line, photons with too little energy to excite
   anything, and finally the effective heating of the baryons due to the injected energy. The
   deposition names are correspondingly 'ion_He', 'ion_H', 'lya', 'lowE', and 'heat'.
   Of course, many injections could lead to not only heating the baryons (or exciting and ionizing them),
   but also create spectral distortions of the baryon blackbody. However, due to the very strong galactic
   influences, we do not expect the spectrum to be anywhere close to blackbody anyway. We thus do not
   model the spectral distortions of baryons.

We thus decided to split the tables into 
 - one which is the baryonic table, the 'deposition_table', that lists all of the
   contributions of energy deposition in the IGM to the state of the baryons, and
   is split among the different types of effects the energy deposition can have
   (dep_type), and
 - one, the 'photon_dep_table', which lists the energy deposition into the photon
   fluid. Of course, the only thing the energy deposition does there is create
   spectral distortions (including g / dT distortions). Thus, we do not to split
   it into different effect types as we do for the baryons.

To calculate the deposited energy, we first calculate the injected energy rate for different physical effects, e.g.
 1) Annihilating particles (e.g. dark matter) as described in Chluba 2010 and Chluba
    & Sunyaev 2012. (see also Chluba 2013 for useful discussion)
 2) Decaying relic particles as described in Chluba 2010 and Chluba & Sunyaev 2012
    (see also Chluba 2013 for useful discussion)
 3) Evaporation of primordial black holes as described in Poulin et al. 2017 (see also
    Tashiro & Sugiyama 2008, Carr et al. 2010 and Carr et al. 2016 for useful discussions) (TODO)
 4) Acctretion of matter into primordial black holes both via
     a) Spherical accretion as described in Ali-Haimoud & Kamionkowski 2017 (TODO) and
     b) Disk accretion as described in Poulin et al. 2017 (TODO)
    (see also Carr et al. 2010 for useful discussion)

Once the rate of energy injection is known, a so-called deposition function is evaluated, which determines the amount of energy effectively deposited into the different effects, i.e. heating, ionization of H, He, Lyman alpha, and low energy for baryons. Also in this case, there are several options
 1) by setting 'chi_type' to 'chi_full_heating', the whole injected energy is going to be
    deposited into heat,
 2) by setting 'chi_type' to 'chi_from_SSCK', the SSCK approximation is employed,
 3) by setting 'chi_type' to 'chi_from_x_file' or 'chi_from_z_file', the user can define own
    deposition functions with respect to the free electron fraction x_e or to redshift, respectively.
    The two files 'example_chix_file.dat' and 'example_chiz_file.dat' are given as example. Note that
    'example_chix_file.dat' has been computed according to the approximations of Galli et al. 2013.

Furthermore, it is also possible to define a so-called injection efficiency, i.e. a factor determining how much of the heating is deposited at all, regardless of the form. There are two options to define this function
 1) the on-the-spot approximation, where the whole injected energy is transformed into deposited energy,
    i.e. f_eff=1, and
 2) reading a precomputed function from an external file.

However, in the above discussion, we have seen that baryons and photons both do receive heating, but react differently to it. In addition, there are some sources of spectral distortions that do not come from injected (and deposited) energy, usually related to the interactions of baryons and photons. This includes
 1) Adiabatically cooling electrons and barions during the thermal history as
    photons and baryons are coupled due to Compton scattering (see Chluba & 
    Sunyaev 2012, Khatri, Sunyaev & Chluba 2012 for useful discussions) 
 2) Dissipation of acoustic waves, a second order contribution evaluated only
    after the perturbations have been found, with two possible
    approximations
     a) Eq. 42 from Chluba, Khatri & Sunyaev 2012 (approximated to Y_SZ*S_ac) (TODO)
     b) Eq. 45 from Chluba, Khatri & Sunyaev 2012
    (The user can select the preferred option with 'heating approx'=yes/no)
    (see Chluba, Khatri & Sunyaev 2012  Chluba 2013 and Diacoumis & Wong 2017
    for useful discussions)
 3) Cosmological recombination radiation as described in Chluba & Ali-Haimoud 2016 (TODO)
All of these additional term, which are not injected and deposited into the IGM in the usual sense, are grouped within the function 'heating_add_noninjected'.

This fills a table of deposited energy in baryons split by the different effects. Additionally, a table of deposited energy in photons is created, mostly similar to the baryon column 'heat', except for the additional effects of non-injected terms.

In conclusion, note that this module is in based on the public version of ExoCLASS (see Stoecker et al. 2018) which has been mainly developed by Vivian Poulin and Patrick St√∂cker.
